## Portfolio made with React

### Introduction

This is a front-end portfolio created using React. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. It is a responsive website that presents my personal information, projects, and experience.

This portfolio was inspired by [Dorota1997](https://github.com/Dorota1997)'s amazing portfolio template. The clean and modern design caught my eye, and I knew I had to use it as inspiration for my own portfolio.

I want to give a special thanks to Dorota1997 for the incredible work she's done and for inspiring me to create my own portfolio.
